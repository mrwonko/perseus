	\section{Common Compiler Generators}
    	
		Lexers and parsers are rarely hand-written any more, since there are plenty of tools to generate them using formal definitions. Let's compare some free and open source examples that can target C/C++ representing different approaches.
		
		\subsection{flex}
		
			flex\cite{flex} generates lexers in C from a definition file describing the tokens using regular expressions and code to be executed upon their recognition, for example suspending scanning and returning a token. The generated C source code is then compiled to get an executable lexer. flex is often used together with bison.
			
			%TODO is one of the oldest (?)
		
		\subsection{bison}
			
			bison\cite{bison} generates LALR and GLR Parsers in C, C++ and Java from a definition file describing the context-free grammar to be accepted. The generated source code is then compiled to get an executable parser.
		
		\subsection{Boost.Spirit}
			
			Boost.Spirit\cite{spirit} is a C++ parser and lexer library. (It also has a module for generator definitions, but that is of no interest here.) It's different from flex and bison (and most other compiler generators) in that it doesn't have a separate generation step; the definitions are made in standard C++.
			
			Boost.Spirit.Lex, the lexer component, lets you define the tokens using strings containing regular expressions. These are parsed and used to generate a deterministic finite automaton at run time, which has the downside that the computations will be repeated at each execution and syntactic errors in the regular expressions can't be detected during compilation. To offset this there's the option to generate equivalent static C++ source code for the calculated automaton on execution, which can then be used in place of the run time version for improved performance. Besides requiring no external tools for compilation it's also very easy to integrate with Boost.Spirit.Qi.
			
			Boost.Spirit.Qi is the parser component. Making heavy use of templates it allows for the definition of the grammar using overloaded operators, creating a recursive descent parser. Instead of calculating a parsing table it uses backtracking, removing the need for a separate tool prior to compilation. It avoids ambiguity through its operator definitions: An alternative $a|b$ is defined as ``if $a$ matches, use that; only try $b$ if it does not,'' while repetitions (including optional symbols) are greedy, matching as much as possible.

	\section{Common Virtual Machines}
		% Stand der Technik, insb. bzgl. VMs / Einordnung
		
		There are numerous virtual machines a compiler may target. Let's look at some interesting ones.
		
		%TODO wording?
		
		\subsection{Java Virtual Machine}
		
			The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) was initially created for Java, but has since been targeted by other languages as well. It is stack-based and uses garbage collection to manage its memory.
			
			%TODO more?
		
		%TODO is Node.js really worth mentioning? It doesn't quite fit?
		%\subsection{Node.js}
			
		%	Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment with a focus on asynchronous execution. It doesn't execute any kind of byte code, it executes JavaScript, and may not completely fit the definition of a virtual machine.
		
		\subsection{LLVM}
		
		%TODO
		intermediate representation, compiler \& interpreter, no coroutines, optional gc
		
		%\subsection{Weitere?}
		
		%Lua VM, C\# VM (CLR - Common Language Runtime, for CIL - Common Intermediate Language), CPython, ...?

\chapter{Requirements}\label{requirements}

	%TODO where does this go? requirements? 
	%Native machine code would require porting work for each new platform. By using a virtual machine, any platform that's capable of running it is supported. My virtual machine requirements are mainly support for coroutines and stack inspection/unwinding, so coroutines can be serialized and aborted properly, and the ability to embed it in C++.
	
	% LLVM: no coroutines, no stack inspection(?)
	% JVM/CLR: garbage collected

\chapter{Evaluating the results}
% Zusammenfassung
% What did I achieve?
% Ergebnisse zusammenfassen, bewerten bzgl. Zielsetzung, Perspektiven
% lessons learned

The goal was mostly reached: A small core of Perseus can be compiled and executed. Compared to the desired target language example (Listing~\ref{lst:target_language}), this is what the actual syntax looks like:

\begin{perseuslisting}[caption={Actual resulting language example},label={lst:result_language}]
function fib( x : i32 ) -> i32
    if x <= 1
        x
    else
    	// precedence must be explicitly defined since function calls are syntactically treated similar to binary operators and operator precedence is not resolved yet.
        ( fib( x - 1 ) ) + ( fib( x - 2 ) )

impure function main()
{
	let index : i32 = 10;
	let result = fib( index );
	print( result )
}
\end{perseuslisting}

That's pretty much on target, sans operator precedence resolution. The error messages for invalid code still leave a lot to be desired though -- they often lack information on the location of the problem. It's technically possible to include this information, and it sometimes is included already, but it was no priority during initial development, so future work in this area is required.

Meanwhile the virtual machine already has support for coroutines in anticipation for their future addition to the language. New opcodes, e.g. for unsigned integer and floating point arithmetic, are easy to add. The main challenge in extending it will probably be the addition of stack inspection and unwinding.

One of the main difficulties during development was figuring out how exactly to use certain features of Boost.Spirit, the compiler generator used. It eventually did its job, removing an additional compiler generation step from the build process as intended; and by taking advantage of C++'s powerful static type system most errors could be caught at compile time.

Due to the usage of the latest C++14 features on a preview release of the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler, a couple of compiler bugs were encountered, but its usage was still justified in that it made writing fast, correct and elegant code noticeably easier than it would have been in C++98. The compiler has since had its full release, which fixed all the bugs that had been encountered.


\section{Resulting translation by example}

Taking listing \ref{lst:result_language} as an example, what do the steps of compilation look like? First, the lexer turns the source code into the following token stream (whitespaces and comments are omitted in this listing for brevity, and some indentation was added to aid comprehension):

\begin{codelisting}[caption="Abridged tokens of listing \ref{lst:result_language}"]
"function", identifier(fib), "(", identifier(x), ":", identifier(i32), ")", "->", identifier(i32),
    "if", identifier(x), operator(<=), decimal literal(1),
        identifier(x),
    "else",
        "(", identifier(fib), "(", identifier(x), operator(-), decimal literal(1), ")", ")", operator(+), "(", identifier(fib), "(", identifier(x), operator(-), decimal literal(2), ")", ")"

"impure", "function", identifier(main), "(", ")",
"{"
    "let", identifier(index), ":", identifier(i32), "=", decimal literal(10), ";"
    "let", identifier(result), "=", identifier(fib), "(", identifier(index), ")", ";"
    identifier(print), "(", identifier(result), ")",
"}"
\end{codelisting}

The parser builds the syntax tree shown in figure \ref{fig:result_language_parser_tree} from these tokens. This syntax tree is then transformed in various ways: Expressions are rearranged, variable references resolved, types checked etc. The result is the transformed syntax tree shown in figure \ref{fig:result_language_transformed_tree}. Based on that byte code is generated -- listing \ref{lst:result_bytecode} shows the generated ``fib'' function in humanly readable format.

\chapter{Future prospects}
% Ausblick
%*  [Future plans/possibilities]

As mentioned only a very simple core of the language has been implemented; there is a lot of room for improvement. There are a couple of comparatively simple features that can be added immediately, but few of them make the language any more powerful. Such changes are for the most part larger in nature, requiring more work, but they are required for the language to become viable.

    \section{Simple additions}
    
    	\subsection{Operator precedence resolution}
    	
    	The most important change at the moment is probably the resolution of operator precedence. Having to manually define precedence using parentheses is inconvenient at best and downright ridiculous in the case of function calls; having to write
		\begin{perseuslisting}
(myFunction()) + 1
		\end{perseuslisting}
		instead of
		\begin{perseuslisting}
myFunction() + 1
		\end{perseuslisting}
		is not acceptable in any way.
		
		\subsection{Variable assignments}
		
		There is also currently no way of changing a variable's value; all variables are effectively immutable. To enable usage of iterative algorithms assignment is necessary, and adding it is fairly straightforward, since determining a variable's location in memory has already been solved for usage of variables in expressions.
		
		\subsection{Tail recursion}
		
		Optimizing tail recursion calls to simply jump back to the beginning of the function is mostly a matter of recognizing them, in which case slightly different code is generated. Not a major change.
		
		\subsection{Better errors}
		
		The syntax tree is not sufficiently annotated with file locations to always get useful errors, but it could and should be.
		
		\subsection{Cleaner API}
		
		The header files are not currently sufficiently separated into interface and implementation; it should be made clearer to the user what he is supposed to include by having those headers in a separate directory.
	
	\section{Complex changes}
		
		\subsection{Upgrade to Boost.Spirit 3}
		
		Version 2 of Boost.Spirit is used, which was the latest stable version when development started. The next version has since been released, with potential improvements in compile time, speed and ease of use. An upgrade should be considered while the code base is still relatively small, before adding many new features.
		
		\subsection{New language features}
		
		Perseus still lacks many features, which need to be added in the future. These include modules, so the code can be separated into smaller pieces; a proper type system that lets the user define custom types; some form of dynamic memory management, on which strings depend; first class functions with closures; coroutines; and the persistence that is so central to the language.
