    \section{Target audience}
    This thesis is written under the assumption that the reader has a solid understanding of the basics of computer science.

	I have a concept for a programming language called Perseus. I envision a strongly typed scripting language with native serialization support -- crucially also for execution contexts, so a paused script can be saved and later resumed, possibly on a different computer.
	
	My goal for this thesis was to create prototypes of a compiler and a virtual machine implementing a small sub set of it, just enough to do basic computations. These can later be built upon to create a full-blown language, but that is outside of the scope of this thesis.
	
	\lstperseus
	\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Desired target language}]
function fib( x : i32 ) -> i32
    // if the function body is a single expression, no {}-delimited block is required
    if x <= 1
        x
    else
        fib( x - 1 ) + fib( x - 2 )

impure function main()
{
	let index : i32 = 10;
	// variable types can be deduced from their initialization
	let result = fib( index );
	// print is an impure built-in function (i.e. it has side effects, in this case writing something), so main() needs to be impure as well to be able to call it
	print( result )
}
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	I will focus on the design and implementation of the compiler and the virtual machine, not the language itself; not least because it is not fully developed yet.
