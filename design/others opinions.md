# What some irc users - presumably in #programming on freenode - had to say

    <mrwonko> in an entirely unrelated poll: what are your favourite programming language features? I like closures and static typing, for example.
    <pintheris> lambda is beautiful
    <b_r_y_a_n_e_d_d_s> algebraic data types and immutability :)
    <dmgrgory> Native vector types. ;)
    
    (unknown) I'd recommend joining #rust-offtopic on irc.mozilla.org:6697 if you've been interested by Rust and programming language design; there are often-ish discussions of programming language design there.
