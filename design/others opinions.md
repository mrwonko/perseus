# What some irc users - presumably in #programming on freenode - had to say

<mrwonko> in an entirely unrelated poll: what are your favourite programming language features? I like closures and static typing, for example.
<pintheris> lambda is beautiful
<b_r_y_a_n_e_d_d_s> algebraic data types and immutability :)
<dmgrgory> Native vector types. ;)
